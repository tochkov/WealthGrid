This project is being develop with the sole purpose to update and improve my technical skills, using the latest technologies, best practices and industry standards.
Using eodhd.com API
Some of the stack covered:
- Jetpack Compose (My first attempt ever, so don't judge too harsh)
- Kotlin Flows - Again my first attempt
- Material3 (Because if I don't hurry they will release 4)
- Hilt for dependency injection
- Compose Navigation (Because, why things should be easy when they can be hard)
- Websockets for live data with Ktor
- Ktorfit for Rest api
- Room for caching and user portfolio data
- Coil for images and image caching
