Portfolio tracker app.
All your asstest in one place - stocks, crypto and more.

This project is being develop with the sole purpose to update and improve my techical skills, using the latest technologies and best practices.

Some of the stack covered:
- Jetpack Compose (My first attempt ever, so don't judge too harsh)
- Material3 (Because if I don't hurry they will release 4)
- Compose Navigation (Because, why things should be easy when they can be hard)
- Dagger Hilt
- Ktorfit

- Trying to be as close as possible to Clean Architecture, with proper MVVM as the presentation layer

- Unit Tests with Junit4 (Decorated with Thruth and Mockk)
